# Reddit_NLP_Stocks
Welcome to the NLP Sentiment Analysis Project focused on analyzing sentiments in Reddit posts related to buying or selling stocks. This project aims to provide insights into how the sentiment of Reddit posts correlates with stock market trends, particularly focusing on discussions about buying or selling stocks.

Project Overview
In this project, we utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to scrape Reddit posts from relevant subreddits and analyze the sentiment expressed in these posts regarding stock trading activities. The sentiment analysis is performed to determine whether the general sentiment towards a particular stock is positive, negative, or neutral.

The primary goals of this project are:

Data Collection: Scrape Reddit posts from chosen subreddits related to stock trading, buying, and selling.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilize NLP techniques to analyze the sentiment of the collected posts.
Visualization: Create visualizations to present the sentiment trends over time and correlate them with stock market movements.
